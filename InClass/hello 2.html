    <h2>My Last Trip</h2>
    <p>
        My last trip was my first time been here in US. My mom has a sister lives in Seattle. Since there was no direct flight to Houston,
        I bought the direct flight to Seattle and lived in my aunt's home. She took me to the Seattle Down-town and to visit the Microsoft.
        I was really excited to visit the Microsoft company. It is my dream to work there, and this trip definetely increase my desire to 
        work there.
